    Calculate the number of "complete" trading days between two

    occurred between start and end, with the caveat that we subtract 1
    from this total if end falls on the same day as the last market
    open and end occurs earlier in its own day than start.  This
    reflects the fact that we haven't completed a full day
    corresponding to the last market open.

    Examples:
    
    1.)
    start = Tuesday, Aug 7, 2012, 1:00 pm

    There is one market open between these dates, on the morning of
    Wednesday the 8th.  This falls on the same calendar day as end,
    but end is later in the day than start, so we count this as a full
    day.  The correct output is 1.

    2.)

    end = Wednesday, Aug 8, 2012, 1:00 pm

    Wednesday the 8th.  This falls on the same calendar day as end,

    day as completed.  The correct output is 0.

    3.)
    start = Tuesday, Aug 7, 2012, 1:00 pm 
    end = Saturday, Aug 11, 2012, 1:30 pm
    
    There are 3 market opens between these dates, occurring on
    Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.  The last open is not on
    the same day as end, so we simply return 3

    4.)
    start = Tuesday, Aug 7, 2012, 1:30 pm 
    end = Monday, Aug, 13, 2012, 1:00 pm
    
    There are 4 market opens between these dates, occurring on
    Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and the following Monday. The 
    last open occurs on the same calendar day as end, and end
    is earlier in the day than start, so we do not count the
